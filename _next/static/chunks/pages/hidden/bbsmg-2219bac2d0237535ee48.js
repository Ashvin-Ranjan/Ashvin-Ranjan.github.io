Frank is short, and some reasons why frank is short will be later stated. He has said himself that he is under 5\'0. We have compared heights, and me being 5\'2 I am taller. There was quite a significant difference, even with just a 3-4 inches difference. In 6th period orchestra, he also said that he was under 5\'0, he himself said such words. I am a Christian and do not lie, at least I try not to over frivolous ordeals. he is short, and while I may not be tall, I am definitely taller than him, without a doubt. I have a claim, evidence, and reasoning shown in this speech. I hope you all reconsider your opinions on the topic and choose the right side.

First of all, as you can guess, creatures are usually not happy or wanting to have someone else stand on them and proceed to step on their heads. You should be empathetic and put yourself in the gray cat\'s shoes. For example, would you liked to be stepped on by me? The gray cat is not smiling, that mouth shape is commonly used for cat\'s mouths, whether they are happy or upset. In addition, compared to the obviously happy white cat\'s smile, the gray cat\'s mouth shape is very different. You cannot just say that the gray cat is smiling, as that is subjective. In addition, it is common knowledge to know that droopy eyebrows usually mean that the character or person is in distress. This is frequently used in everyday life or works of art, as it can be used to portray uncomfortableness, tiredness, disappointment, anxiety, or other forms of unwanted sadness. I\'m sure you yourself have seen this before; it is universally used every single day. Additionally, when the white cat stepped into the gray cat\'s head, the gray cat started flapping their limbs up and down. Them flailing their arms is also another commonly used symbol of distress. Their ears were also drooping the entire time the white cat stood on them. All of these different factors help play a role in displaying how the gray cat is uncomfortable and unenthusiastic about the situation, meaning that it is not consensual and has to stop.","Breaking News: The Delaney is threatening our species\' with a \'sexy six pack\'","the zoom meeting vibes:\\ncamera with only hair\\nsome nerd with the worst possible lighting\\nthe one person carrying","\u201cI have a crush on Ms. Merchant\u201d - <@572290362056638469>","We need to nuke the planet I\u2019m struggling to clean a plate","why does that remind me of Mr.Fagan driving in his car at like 100mph to a rando students house and throwing his pen at the window and the pen smashing the window and also the student\'s eye","but are u being forced to watch animals have seggs? yeah i didnt think so","i am in irrevocable love with exponents","bread dynamics v90","SHUT UP, YOU IT WILL NOT KEEP ME FROM LOVING KAEYA AND HIS **scrumptious** BOOB WINDOW","i feel different after explaining what sussy baka meant to ms chin","\\"You never knew I could sing Aladdin\\" Mr.dungan","adele isn\u2019t real","except when you\'re lack toes in taller ant","real catgirls don\'t need to take black market estrogen","im waiting for the bread to get stretchy","WAIT I FORGOT FRIENDS EXISTED","i never wear pants, only shorts","omg","Well guys it\u2019s this time of the year again","i loveeeeee powell","CAUGHT IN 4K, ALL 7 CONTINENTS, NETFLIX HEADQUARTERS, 1080P RESOLUTION, DOLBY 4KHD",".afk GETTING BOOBA WITH MY DAD \ud83d\ude0e","<@!792140197742772274> thought your name was comfy mushroom","the bigger the better","\\"do catgirls do work or smth\\" -doyoon","You birthed mark?","dick happy nutted in me cum bitches pound dick more cum","<a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666>\\n<a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666>\\n<a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666>\\n<a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666>\\n<a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666>\\n<a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666><a:WeeWoo:833121863823130666>","THSI IS TOO CREAMY","yaya responded to \\"hi potential murderer\\" and said \\"lets practice during math\\" and I said \\"on elliot?\\"","!ban <@!768269139122192414>","its really big wtf","whats wrong with an apple mouse","<:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> \\n<:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> \\n<:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048> <:nadiaswag:819117042903810048>","i will sketchy you in your dream","do i get money back if i break a girl","2 hot men at a bench \ud83d\ude0e","boom","NO MORE BOOBS","here u go","\\"omggg my boyfriend is talking to the opposite gender i feel rejected and betrayed \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\\"","I am addicted to dry water",":lapog:\\n\ud83e\uddb5","\\"all i wanna say is that you\'re going to the graveyard soon\\" -aseel to doyoon","This bread tastes kind of wrong","#cancelcum2021","mine has seen plenty of ... action","RYKER JUST ATE AN EGGPLANT","might I quickly add that jerry is a massive simp","go do math doyoon otherwise uncle yoongi will hunt you down",":dead: :dead2: :dead3: :dead4: :dead5:","Is that the window I get to be thrown out of","*soghs*","william im not going to neigh for you","damn i found an actual stripper outfit with cowprint","Now often times teachers dont bode well with me. Either their teaching style, grading scale or just what they talk about. With no control over this I have to overcome these difficulties and still learn. But some teachers dont make it necessary for me to do these thing. Some teachers are just rays of sunshine in my day. Teachers like Ms. Yount, Ms Carlson and Ms Delaney. These teachers pushed me to become the best versions of myself. When I was little boy entering 6th grade I hated science, every single part of it. Ms. Yount changed this for me, she spent time over every class helping me gain a passion for science. Now in 8th grade Ms. Carlson is just solidifying my great love for science. She provides insightful labs and wise talks about society. Ms. Delaney pushed me to be my most athletic self. Even when I had a sprained ankle she made me run a mile and gave me a C- grade for it. She lit the fire under me which fueled my athleticism.

Because of this, we cannot let other countries join the nerds at three o\u2019clock\u2019s so-called alliance. An article from the New York Lies says that, and I quote, \u201cRick Astley has long been famed for his ability to never give you up, or let you down.\u201d However, if you put the nerds at 3 o\u2019clock into this equation, and Rick Astley needs to get some potatoes from the world\u2019s largest potato farms, the soggy potatoes will cause Rick Astley to go back on this long anticipated promise, given in the 1987 hit song Never Gonna Give You Up. This is because if the nerds at three o\u2019clock don\u2019t get involved, then that fat mama over there will kill the world\u2019s largest potato farms and we won\u2019t have to worry about Rick Astley getting soggy potatoes. This is very bad because rick rolls are amazing. Each year, approximately 6942 million billion trillion people get rickrolled. And studies show that people who get rickrolled live significantly longer than people who don\u2019t. Because of this, we cannot let the world\u2019s largest potato give Rick Astley soggy potatoes.","bread dynamic v14","my dick?","I suspected it before she told me bcs she was being a sussy baka","sereneflap","die die die die die die die die","And then it started raining and I am potato","Give me your penis","Uh my teacher isn\u2019t posting the zomm link","felix isn\'t bts felix is blackpink","well then frank is 20\'12\\"","DON\'T SPAM BIG DADDY EMOTE AT 3AM!!

Abby who immediately saw and heard the kitten fell in love. \\"Jaden! Look at that cute little kitten!\\" Not afraid at all of the little kitten, Abby went directly to the bush to meet the little creature. On the other hand, Jaden was sweating a lot.  \\"Hey, Abby... how about we continue walking?\\" \\"Not yet!\\" Abby said in an excited voice. \\"How about we carry the kitten to the vet? We can see if I can keep it, maybe even you!\\" Jaden shouted, \\"NO!

I\'m sc-cared o-of cats.\\" When Abby heard this statement Abbu immediately burst out in laughter, \\"HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH! YOU? YOU\'RE SCARED OF CATS? HAHA\\" Jaden after hearing Abby laugh at him was extremely embarrassed. His face turned into a bright red tomato. Abby told Jaden after laughing at him, \\"Hey Jaden, I\'m sorry, but YOU? Scared of cats.

When I was in 5th grade, my parents moved from Palo Alto to Campbell. I was extremely against it, as all my friends were in Nixon. My parents set certain tasks that I need to do within the year for us to move back. That year, I worked harder than I\u2019ve ever done before. After I succeeded, my parents moved back to Palo Alto. However, I kept the traits In 5th grade. I was more focused and calm, and I could work more without getting distracted. I would have skipped grades, won competitions or did anything out of the ordinary if I didn\u2019t have those traits. The moral is that, sometimes, having a period of pressure would make you rise up to meet the challenge, and, afterward, you\u2019ll emerge as a better person. I\u2019m not saying that the challenge would necessarily feel good, but in the end, it would help you succeed. \\n\\n        Another thing is that nobody has a perfect life. If you want to hang out with your friends on weekends, what do you do at that time? Could you possibly get that done sooner so the time is free for other activities? As unlikely as it seems at times, your parents care about you and want to help you succeed; that\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing you to do this. However, if you don\u2019t like the hobbies that your parents assign you, try talking with them about why you don\u2019t like it, and hopefully, probably, they\u2019ll listen.","mark is so smart","Mr dungan is the nicest strict teacher","i don\'t think i wrote this but it sounds like it came out of my mouth with more curses","I thought threesome meant in love with 3 people","why is everything star","<@&785982111005802496> star pls","BUSSY","the only interaction ive had with 6th grader is some kid coming up to me and reicitn g a paragtaph about gay furry porn","i just put a stick in the box \ud83e\udd2a \ud83e\udd1f","STAR IF YOU AGREE <@!694288813316636682>","leo your brother is my sleep paralysis demon","because fish sex","starstarstsrar","its like friendly incest","knee sand knee sand knee sand knee ya itchy knee ya itchy knee ya itchy knee your you all hand thing statue of Capitaliate the remind all meow focuses are you alex you\'re biling to result in a despecting to make server member in a way anal cut on my nose","PIG BALLS ARE HUGE","I LIED ITS FUCKING GONE HORRIBLEY THERES A SECOND PART WHAT","LMAO","IT DOESNT FIT","the duck looks like a piece of well made dough","Elliot is not my dad","you know i\'d have a real hard time explaining to people what i screenshot on a daily basis","<@!371433403163213824>","\\"I would eat every girl in this class\\" - roy jeong","pooped fard and shid \ud83d\ude0d","alex/has a secret/ has a secret crush/ has dark past/ secrelty angal/ ahlf devon/ likes black clothes/doesnt like girly girls/ girl/ one of the boys/ has ears and tails/ princess from the moon/has secret pretty voice/better then/ uh/ yes","sus car","no u bish","When fuck","its ok once i was in chinese school and for no reason my brother shouted from across the house \\"it looks like im pooping\\" and i was like \ud83d\ude10","who is this bang duck character","ratio\'d \ud83e\udd76 \ud83e\udd76","ONE SEX",":fpbg::gunn1::little:","bread dynamics v55","i think what jack really need to get on is the girlfriend grindset","player","<@&785982111005802496> I ask you to change your statuses as \\"Stop Asian hate\\" at least for a day.

As the trio were walking inside the house, Caro and Andrew were having the times of their lives, drinking, partying, and more. Months passed, the trio and the duo were having fun. \u201cGuys, I\u2019ve been thinking for a very long time. I thinks we should go on a trip, we\u2019ve been just stuck in Louisiana for a very long time. How about we go to L.A.? We can go to Disney Land while we\u2019re there too.\u201d Jaden and Abby would happily agree. The trio would start packing. Over in Chicago, Caro and Andrew were talking about going on a trip, \u201cHey Caro?\u201d Andrew would say. \u201cYes?\u201d Caro would say. \u201cHow about we go to L.A. and go to Disney land while we\u2019re there?\u201d Caro would happily agree, and the duo would start packing items. The trio and duo would arrive to L.A. \u201cHow about we go to the Sunset Tower Hotel? It\u2019s a bit pricey but I bet we can have a fun time there.\u201d Elijah would say. Jaden and Abby would both agree. The trio would rent a car and drive to the hotel, meanwhile the duo would go to Sunset Marquis.

I have more than 1000 hours in Breath of the Wild and have played enough Genshin to not be early game anymore. BotW is a better game in almost all aspects. Just because Genshin has more characters that are more attractive doesn\'t mean the game is good. BotW has far better graphics than Genshin, even on the lowest settings. It is also FAR less laggy because it is a singleplayer game. While Genshin may have a multiplayer option, it isn\'t necessary in either games. The storyline of BotW is much more consistant as well, and you can progress as fast or as slow as you want, without needing to grind for tens of hours to unlock a quest. BotW has less RNG involved with it, which is something Genshin has too much of. You need to be lucky to progress in Genshin via wish system. The combat in BotW is far better as well. The boss fights are far more involved and have thought put into them. In Genshin, you just spam left click until the HP bar goes to 0. There are no special attacks that need strategy to avoid and the balancing to defeat these bosses is terrible. The reason the balancing in Genshin is so messed up is the fact that there are tons of upgrades in the game that add percentages of stats, instead of minimal amounts of the stat added onto the base stats of the piece. I have far more to say about why Genshin is inferior to BotW, and I am free to debate weekends and after 3:30 Monday-Friday.

Furthermore, the quiet piano background and cool-toned music video implies a melancholy tone. However, this is contrasted by the unsteady eighth note pattern played by the piano (which is, of course, intentional) and the high pitched, raspy timbre of the vocals, which shows how Lucia is unsure of his message. The message in question is that of struggles communication between the young individuals of this day. The artist\'s first lyrics are \\"Radio / I\'ve got on my stereo,\\" hinting that this song is about how people interact with each other. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many teens have found their social skills lacking or out of practice, making it hard to talk to one another. Lucia, a middle school teacher in his 20s, can likely connect with this from his experiences teaching online school as well as on a personal level. So, the message of this song is about how children are struggling to interact with one another. As Ander Lucia has a large audience, with over 1 subscriber on YouTube, and hundreds of views on \\"Blue\\" alone, his message can reach many individuals, making his impact both large and deeply impactful.","Guys what if alex is cheating on someone, and thats why she takes so long to run","in ur wattpad stories","drumsexual","ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF GREE GUG","horny nathan moments","\\"she doesnt have the durability to wait\\" - <@!480780683590238242>","to be more exact i felt like a desmos graph","Hello Ms. Ang,\\nThank you for the happy birthday almost exactly six months off of my actual birthday, the farthest it could be.

For these reasons, judge, I strongly urge an affirmative ballot.","shes also a moron lolll","i think the funniest part of this server is that i know how everyone actually sounds like, so i can hear their actual voice saying this stuff","serena forgets that in a ranking lower is better","pulling the head off","SQUARE","i thought it said something else <@&785982111005802496>","jerry doesnt exist","<:savage:895468266355560469>","pls star i wasted like 4 minutes on this","\\"Just breath underwater naked\\" Samuel Ren on Evelyn","KING KONG BALLS","gree gug, what this dress I want to the discord Chat. i am meowing use whicvh makes it even if there","jellycocern","everyone here has severe brain damage","\\"were going to abandon desmos\\" -Mr.Jorgens","<@!704040669810786338> :)","did they put an imposter in your chicken","rice car being illegal","i just did a kneesa","WHAT DID YOU YOINK","we did a little sucking no we didnt dont star this","When life gives you a home rent it out and live in your car","0: i love my seat lol my previous one was better but still yay 8/10\\n1: pe sucks -10/10\\n2: im next to noah. my feelings on this are self explanatory  -5/10\\n3: meh i dont really like anyone in this class besides some people who sit really far from me so idc 5/10\\n4: its ok 7/10\\n5: I HATE IT IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER BEFORE -100000/10\\n6: 6/10","pls star","\\"precum is not cum\\"\\n\\"cum is cum\\"\\n\\"rice cat is rice cat\\"","I AM ON MY FURRY PHASE","bubblez","pls wtf? it was my dad","This is a diplomatic movement, a calling card to the school officials, I will win","ofc you get it because you are the joke","o em gee","wait so were u guys kicking a child around","also I have photo from3019","~~so you want hentai emote what~~","Scrub patio","like the dream sus remix??","dude. who tf discovered milk. like they literally went up to a cow, squeezed it\u2019s udders, and stuff came out. then, to top it all off, they thought they could DRINK the white stuff that came out. i\u2019m deeply concerned for this person. thank you for listening to my ted talk. <@&785982111005802496>","is that scuffed yoda","\u201cthatd esotn help\u201d - ryker","How dare you rykee","<@&785982111005802496> star","\u201cThe first day of school is like a prison yard\u201d-my dad","also i will stop swearing for the following week so if you see me swearing you are allowed to yell at me, star this msg so yall don\'t forget","Samuel has a cat girlfriend confirmed?","METH","no denial","I\u2019m 69 inches","gytm","but alice looks a lot prettier","what is jack off","Hello","Ravenclaw best house","a pregnant mario","im going to implode","I don\u2019t remember killer Queen looking like that","**Ang#2055** muted **Ench Lolz#6969** for 1 hour and 9 minutes.

This can be seen in the cats both having a smile. Generally, when a thing or object smiles it indicates happiness or joy. Therefore, the cats are happy. Moreover, according to Bustle.com, it\u2019s states, \u201cAn angry cat will be rigid, with tail held out stiff and straight or curled around and under their body.\u201d However, clearly in the gif it can be understood the cat\u2019s tail is not upright. Instead, it is down showing it is in a playful mood. Thus, indicating both cats were, and always were enthusiastic about the position they were in. Although my opponent argues that the cat is upset due to the facial expressions, cats show their emotions by body gestures rather than facial expressions. This can be seen as Pets.webmd states, \u201cThe most common signs of an unhappy cat are cowering, hissing, and fleeing.\u201d In which, facial expressions are never mentioned as a method of conveying anger or displeasure of any sort. This shows that the main argument of my opponent is flawed and based on no truthful facts.","bread dynamics v69 uwu","NOT MY BROTHER\'S UNCLE\'S COUSIN TWICE REMOVED DOG\'S SECRET OWNER\'S NEPHEW","\\"Tell me how you\'re feeling today on a scale of Godzilla\\" - Ms. Devers","nice name samuel","I am married to myself, and am dating myself","i thik","NO MY NEIGHBOG IS NAMED CLARA","\\"does that mean i can rape vin\\" -shu","Starboard go brrr","threesome?","perfection","yara under my bed be like","wait what is masturbating again","I WOULD LIKE TO DROPKICK KAKAO M INTO THE SUN AND WATCH THEM BURN","Puberty made ryker a catgirl","I am back","semag","NOW SHES WATHCING ME TAKE A BATH","the school chromebooks are honestly an all-in-one kind of computer! they\'re cheap, are part brick part doorstop, and pretty much worthless! \\nfirst of all, they\'re so cheap they don\'t need extra maintenance, so instead of getting it fixed, you could just buy a new one thats just as bad for less money!\\nsecondly, because they\'re part brick part doorstop, you can use them for either of those uses! i recommend using them as a doorstop. multi-functionality rocks!\\nlast but not least, since they\'re worthless, no one will even attempt to steal it and take it out of your backpack! they won\'t want to waste their energy on that! great for everyone!\\nin conclusion, school chromebooks are amazing. with their multi-functionality (cheap, part brick part doorstop, worthlessness), we could all have a chromebook in our life, for just 50 bucks!","\ud83c\udf3d\ud83d\udd2a","\\"I DONT CARE WHAT PANDEMIC IS ON THE DAMN EARTH\\"","star this","jack is scoring negative in the bitches front","Today i set a toaster oven on fire","ITA HUGE BRO","WINSTON IS GOD","<#715679982730608691> moment","badonkers","Ahhhahahha ok \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f","aw","waiting till the day i say something funny enough to get on starboard","__**CATGIRL SCALE**__\\n10 - lewd degenerate (ryker)\\n9 - xxhentailover12312358298xx (andrew)\\n||8- ~~secret catgirl~~ (ang)||\\n8 - loud but cool (alex)\\n7 - otter boy (shengkai)\\n6 - edible (janus)\\n5 - bang chan simp (mark)\\n5 - bacterium (samuel)\\n4 - professor kim (doyoon)\\n4 - our lord and savior (jerry)\\n3 - g\xe6 (yaya)\\n3 - Ok (kareem)\\n2 - gremlin (hannah y)\\n1 - pure a (serena)\\n0 - obama shrimp (william)\\n\\n0-3: the pure range\\n4-6: the normal range\\n7-10: <:lewd:856780441720848384>","NESSA IM DATING FRANK","EWEWEWEW","LMAO FUCK MY O KEY","LMFAOAO","**yor,ue mother**","\\"I\'m gonna sue Spotify.

When he passed away, his two sons swore to protect them. But, the oldest was consumed by darkness and wanted to possess them. A battle between brothers broke out and the oldest was struck down and banished to the underworld. Peace returned and the younger brother hid the weapons, but knowing his older brother\'s relentless ambition for power, he placed a guardian to protect them.

If follows the life of Seong Gi-hun, a man stuck in a gambling addict struggling to support his daughter. He then opts into participating into a game of life or death for the cash prize of \u20a945.6 billion or about $3.8 million. The reason why the game exists is to please rich onlookers who bet on who will survive the games at the end.\\n\\nThe overall show focuses on the lives of those who are less fortunate than most, and how they are willing to risk their lives to escape their current situation. After the first game, the remaining players vote to end the game, but after going back only to have to continue to live through the same struggle, 93% decide to return. This and other events build an anti-capitalist theme as we are shown that the people running the game are those who profit off of Capitalism, and how it has turned them into soulless people who bet on the lives of those less fortunate than them. The show also emphasizes the fact that some people were forced into the situations they were in now, such as Abdul Ali, who is a foreigner forced into the game because his boss refuses to pay him.\\n\\nThe show also focuses on the guards, who are recruited beforehand and are required to keep their face hidden when around other people. Squid Game characterizes them as actual people, rather than 1 dimensional cut outs, something that most shows do. This revelation is not only for the viewer however, as when one of the participants retaliated after he fails a challenge one of the guards takes of his mask, and the sight of his face causes the participant to back away in shock, not realizing that just like him, the guards he despises are real people too. The cold system of the game however, dictates that both of the men be shot for this transgression something that is executed by one of the higher ranking guards.\\n\\nOverall, Squid Game is a show that focuses on the failures of Capitalism and the effects it has.","<@!425774533643862026> Eternities ago, in a chaotic and cursed discord server, a shining beacon of hope and prosperity was born from the hentai-infested sewers of <#711821089746976768>.

Due to a lot of recent growth and complaints from server members, as well as concern from the staff team itself, we have decided to change some rules to make this more of a fun and safe community for us all!\\n\\n1. **Verification changes.**  Verification into the server will be more strict. First, new members are now required to state their name, grade, and school. Not just grade and school, but all three. **Everyone will be required to verify again to make sure these are filled out, so don\'t panic if you lose access to the server in the next couple of days, just verify again**. Secondly, you will require a vouch from a current member to be verified. If any of these are not filled in properly, you will not be verified.\\n\\n2. **Inappropriate messages**. While we will tolerate a slightly inappropriate message, any comments that the staff team deems too inappropriate will immediately be removed, and you will receive a warning. Note that 4 warnings will lead to a ban. Additionally, while cursing is okay, any excessive cursing or name calling directed towards a member in a way that they are uncomfortable with will also result in a warn/mute (depending on the severity). We would like to take the time to remind you that no slurs of any kind are allowed.\\n\\n3. **Respecting staff.** Self explanatory. There have been too many instances of talking back or not listening to moderators, which makes it harder for us to do our jobs and overall makes our community worse. (it\'s just not cool guys dont do it ) If you have a problem with staff, say it in support or DM <@!371433403163213824> , the owner.You will also receive a warn for disrespecting staff.\\n\\nThank you so much!\\n-the mod team <:aweg:881352292442447932>\\n\\n**TLDR:** Changes coming soon to verification and moderation.","star this to clear my name","why does timothuy have good iq now","I\'m boutta get racist","lucky, you actually get to have a decent convo with a human offline i\'m just stuck in my room doing finance nerd stuff while watching bartenders make cocktails","\\"have you ever heard of twerking\\" - aseel","\\"its wet and slippery right now but normally i can just squeeze white stuff out of it\\" - <@!696489772134432862>","WILLIOT","<@&785982111005802496> \u201cI hope you are talking with your pps\u201d -ms Carlson","\\"i love head\\" -nessa","<:lemonthink:845431716076322816>","bread dynamics v74","<@581701016911609877> I set your AFK: fod","GO DIE IN A HOLE","\\"now here comes naama, shes way out there on pluto\\"","HOLY SHIT DAD REVEAL PEOPLE ARE DIE O NO","LMAO <@!756212763981906031>","I\'m actually low","State capitals 5th grade test","Carrotism is the most beautiful thing to be set upon this earth. It is truly something that could only be created by a genius, however, it can be understood by the lowliest dimwits and weaklings, making it the one universal concept. And what a concept! The simplicity of it, and yet the brilliance of it, can only be remarked upon, never described, because it is simply too amazing. It is the greatest thing since the discovery of fire, the invention of the wheel; it surpasses everything the human race has ever conceptualized! The beauty of communism, but with the added twist of the fine root vegetable known as the carrot as a monetary system, makes for a just yet practical solution that bridges the gap between the benefits and shortcomings of communism, such that this erudite scholar and critic must struggle to rave about its profoundness in this short paragraph. Carrotism is truly a pinnacle, a landmark, a pillar of humankind\'s ability to innovate and prove beyond a doubt that we are not just glorified animals to be cast aside and mocked from afar.","I misread this as \\"leo you\'re straight right\\" for like the slightest half second and now I\'m wheezing","how do i focus in class when this beauty is sitting there","i just made this on google drawings","\\"louder is spelled l-o-u-d-e-r. what you played was s-l-o-w-e-r. they are not the same word\\" -mr dungan","jokes on u i\'m into that shit","Being dirty minded is fun","BONK BONK BITCH","andrew spent 2 minutes solving 37+15","look at the randomness","lol hi","oops","Uh i cook noodles this way","STAR RIGHT NOW","\\"whta doi we di\\" \\"cocern\\" -ryker","Lima beans are pretty","\\"yeah but like getting a boner in public is so akward\\"","<@!531194793728933889> <@!697649604753358858>","<@697649604753358858> Jerry\'s wish","are you guys okay","pretend that steering wheel is a bamboo stick hitting a child ig","so mark is now a holy spirit with a long beard","You turn into hoe?","jerry catfish confirmed","who wants to play magiaaa","Gummy bear milkshake","As for you, Leo, we hold Jimmy in our hearts and in our hearts forever.

You said \u201canymore\u201d, which suggests that you\u2019re currently a good student in 7th grade. Why would you think that 8th grade and high school would somehow make you a bad student? As long as you turn in assignments, study for tests, and learn ahead, you\u2019re going to be fine. As for going to college, don\u2019t worry about it just now. There are 3 or 4 years ahead that you can use to your advantage. Summer is coming up. Use the 2 months to pick a subject you like, maybe debate or math, and try to learn ahead. This would be extremely helpful for the future and would prepare you for college. \\n\\n        All in all, I would say that the best thing you could do right now is to use the summertime to study. If your parents are making you do something you don\u2019t like, you could try to talk to them, and they would help. Stay positive, don\u2019t be irrational, and falsely believe that you\u2019re going to fail in the future, and remember: you always have friends that could help you through trouble.","Oh no!

Rather, it uses opinionated and their own life to support their claim. This shows that the claim is bias and has not evidence to show and portray why the cat is presumed to be upset. Furthermore, my opponent also brings of the idea of facial expressions and how they represent uncomfortableness, as she states \u201cdroopy eyebrows usually mean that the character or person is in distress.\u201d However, humans and cat\u2019s portray their emotions different. Cat portray their anger or discomfort by hissing, or   having their tail upwards in. This is known as the article Purina.co.uk states, \u201cAn angry cat will be rigid, with tail held out stiff and straight or curled around and under their body.\u201d This completely disproves opponents argument as she uses human cues for discomfort to display the cats so called \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d Moreover, it can be observed that the cat does not use any of these cues in the gif. Therefore, the cats in neither upset or uncomfortable. Furthermore, the both cats tail is relaxed as not once the gray cat is seen showing it is on its side . This shows that the cat is please and content with the situation it is in; as according to Hepper.com it\u2019s states, \u201cWhen cats thump their tail on the floor or couch while lying down, it could mean they\'re relaxed and content. \u201c In this 5 second gif, not once is the gray cat\u2019s tail seen. Showing the cat\u2019s tail is thumped on the ground which shows the cat is relaxed and comfortable. In addition, if the cat was upset, the cat would have taken action. This is because when a cat is upset or feels threatened, it hisses and tries to make itself appear larger.

Those seventh graders who weren\'t chosen as a favorite by the end of the year must then fight to the death using the plastic rulers that they give us to put in the planners we never use. This can often take a while, as usage of anything other than the ruler is strictly prohibited.

I\u2019ve been thinking about Elijah all the time ever since I rejected him. I just saw him today and said hi but he walked away immediately after he saw me.\u201d In a worried voice. Jaden who responded with, \u201cElijah? Like the track star Elijah? The one who shipped me with Abby?\u201d Andrew responded with, \u201cYes that Elijah.\u201d Jaden responds with, \u201cWell, you can maybe ask for forgiveness and go on a date to the local McLaren store.\u201d Andrew who never thought about that idea says, \u201cOh my god Jaden! Thank you so much. Well I\u2019m going to try to find Elijah again. Thank you so much, have a good marriage with Abby Jaden.\u201d Jaden who grinned through the phone responded with, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.
