If follows the life of Seong Gi-hun, a man stuck in a gambling addict struggling to support his daughter. He then opts into participating into a game of life or death for the cash prize of \u20a945.6 billion or about $3.8 million. The reason why the game exists is to please rich onlookers who bet on who will survive the games at the end.\n\nThe overall show focuses on the lives of those who are less fortunate than most, and how they are willing to risk their lives to escape their current situation. After the first game, the remaining players vote to end the game, but after going back only to have to continue to live through the same struggle, 93% decide to return. This and other events build an anti-capitalist theme as we are shown that the people running the game are those who profit off of Capitalism, and how it has turned them into soulless people who bet on the lives of those less fortunate than them. The show also emphasizes the fact that some people were forced into the situations they were in now, such as Abdul Ali, who is a foreigner forced into the game because his boss refuses to pay him.\n\nThe show also focuses on the guards, who are recruited beforehand and are required to keep their face hidden when around other people. Squid Game characterizes them as actual people, rather than 1 dimensional cut outs, something that most shows do. This revelation is not only for the viewer however, as when one of the participants retaliated after he fails a challenge one of the guards takes of his mask, and the sight of his face causes the participant to back away in shock, not realizing that just like him, the guards he despises are real people too. The cold system of the game however, dictates that both of the men be shot for this transgression something that is executed by one of the higher ranking guards.\n\nOverall, Squid Game is a show that focuses on the failures of Capitalism and the effects it has.", "to who", "due to the transitive property, nessa is gone", "IT ISNT JUST YOU DW DW", "<@807519881377218560> Your order has arrived!

Due to a lot of recent growth and complaints from server members, as well as concern from the staff team itself, we have decided to change some rules to make this more of a fun and safe community for us all!\n\n1. **Verification changes.**  Verification into the server will be more strict. First, new members are now required to state their name, grade, and school. Not just grade and school, but all three. **Everyone will be required to verify again to make sure these are filled out, so don't panic if you lose access to the server in the next couple of days, just verify again**. Secondly, you will require a vouch from a current member to be verified. If any of these are not filled in properly, you will not be verified.\n\n2. **Inappropriate messages**. While we will tolerate a slightly inappropriate message, any comments that the staff team deems too inappropriate will immediately be removed, and you will receive a warning. Note that 4 warnings will lead to a ban. Additionally, while cursing is okay, any excessive cursing or name calling directed towards a member in a way that they are uncomfortable with will also result in a warn/mute (depending on the severity). We would like to take the time to remind you that no slurs of any kind are allowed.\n\n3. **Respecting staff.** Self explanatory. There have been too many instances of talking back or not listening to moderators, which makes it harder for us to do our jobs and overall makes our community worse. (it's just not cool guys dont do it ) If you have a problem with staff, say it in support or DM <@!371433403163213824> , the owner.You will also receive a warn for disrespecting staff.\n\nThank you so much!\n-the mod team <:aweg:881352292442447932>\n\n**TLDR:** Changes coming soon to verification and moderation.", "PLS SEXUAL MUSIC?", "i had a thinig with henry in english", "I WONT FUCK", "alex's thoughts on jack", "William is cheating on Tesla, Timothy, Nessa's mothers, and all of our moms", "YO WHAT??", "serena why did you switch between 3 topics in less than 10 seconds", "cumming at 7 \ud83d\ude08", "<:pograt:895893434370498572>", "yes", "i need to investigate roy's feet", "suck my dick", "uwu mommy?", "in ur wattpad stories", "also why is it barking seductively", "i am the baddest bitch in palo alto", "okay have you ever thought about what kind of crazy mf invented milk. like they went up to a cow and squeezed its udders. who does that? idk. once they do that, stuff comes out of the udders. white stuff. nice. cool. but why the fuck did they think you could drink the white stuff? are- are they- are they okay. like its bad enough you go up to a cow and squeeze its udders, and realize stuff comes out. but why the fuck do you drink the stuff that comes out bro. what. i am traumatized at this thought. <@&785982111005802496>", "do you want to have (platonic) gay anal sexual intercourse on this fine evening", "Eggs get your eggs here fresh and white eggs are here wiggle jiggle yellow middle that's the best of what you are white and tender surround the center cozy in a cracking shell eggs eggs come into my tuuummmy oh so very yuuuuummy crack crack crack wiggle jiggle eggs and come to me get your eggs fresh eggs white eggs so eggs like the sky above", "both of these messages really resonate with me", "WAIT LMAO", "I HAVE BIGGER FEET THEN MY OWN MOTHER", "serena is talking about bottoms", "silly willy x lima beans", "Bark", "Racist?", "jack is gone", "bread dynamic v9", "Everyone gets a lil damp", "we did this for frank", "\u2b50 \ud83c\udf1f \u2728", "no foot feathers?? \ud83d\ude14", "\ud83d\udc83", "the number", "It\u2019s about rice it\u2019s about flour you stay hungry I devour", "do you gents want to put on your trainers and take some prams down to the off license to get some biscuits and crisps?", "star this.", "how to make pillagers se", "-tofu", "a beautiful marriage", "nessa im feeling fruity rn", "RYJER", "bread dynamic v11", "that means so much frank, father, brother, prophet of the NN amongus, and boyfriend", "<@!581701016911609877> i just found this.", "omg sean noticed me \ud83d\ude33", "WHY DID THAT GET STARRED", "why", "crime", "this is still killing me", "bread dynamic v14", "bread dynamics v13 (I GOT ITJSJJD)", "Thanks everyone!
