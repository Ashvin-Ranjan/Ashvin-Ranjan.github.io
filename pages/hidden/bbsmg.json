  "\u200d        Before 5th grade, I was normally pretty hyper and unproductive (Agastya could attest to this if you ask him), not spending a lot of time studying, and when I study, I would become distracted very quickly. When I was in 5th grade, my parents moved from Palo Alto to Campbell. I was extremely against it, as all my friends were in Nixon. My parents set certain tasks that I need to do within the year for us to move back. That year, I worked harder than I\u2019ve ever done before. After I succeeded, my parents moved back to Palo Alto. However, I kept the traits In 5th grade. I was more focused and calm, and I could work more without getting distracted. I would have skipped grades, won competitions or did anything out of the ordinary if I didn\u2019t have those traits. The moral is that, sometimes, having a period of pressure would make you rise up to meet the challenge, and, afterward, you\u2019ll emerge as a better person. I\u2019m not saying that the challenge would necessarily feel good, but in the end, it would help you succeed. \n\n        Another thing is that nobody has a perfect life. If you want to hang out with your friends on weekends, what do you do at that time? Could you possibly get that done sooner so the time is free for other activities? As unlikely as it seems at times, your parents care about you and want to help you succeed; that\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing you to do this. However, if you don\u2019t like the hobbies that your parents assign you, try talking with them about why you don\u2019t like it, and hopefully, probably, they\u2019ll listen.",

It is truly something that could only be created by a genius, however, it can be understood by the lowliest dimwits and weaklings, making it the one universal concept. And what a concept! The simplicity of it, and yet the brilliance of it, can only be remarked upon, never described, because it is simply too amazing. It is the greatest thing since the discovery of fire, the invention of the wheel; it surpasses everything the human race has ever conceptualized! The beauty of communism, but with the added twist of the fine root vegetable known as the carrot as a monetary system, makes for a just yet practical solution that bridges the gap between the benefits and shortcomings of communism, such that this erudite scholar and critic must struggle to rave about its profoundness in this short paragraph. Carrotism is truly a pinnacle, a landmark, a pillar of humankind's ability to innovate and prove beyond a doubt that we are not just glorified animals to be cast aside and mocked from afar.",

  "Hey <@&785981817488015360> ! Due to a lot of recent growth and complaints from server members, as well as concern from the staff team itself, we have decided to change some rules to make this more of a fun and safe community for us all!\n\n1. **Verification changes.**  Verification into the server will be more strict. First, new members are now required to state their name, grade, and school. Not just grade and school, but all three. **Everyone will be required to verify again to make sure these are filled out, so don't panic if you lose access to the server in the next couple of days, just verify again**. Secondly, you will require a vouch from a current member to be verified. If any of these are not filled in properly, you will not be verified.\n\n2. **Inappropriate messages**. While we will tolerate a slightly inappropriate message, any comments that the staff team deems too inappropriate will immediately be removed, and you will receive a warning. Note that 4 warnings will lead to a ban. Additionally, while cursing is okay, any excessive cursing or name calling directed towards a member in a way that they are uncomfortable with will also result in a warn/mute (depending on the severity). We would like to take the time to remind you that no slurs of any kind are allowed.\n\n3. **Respecting staff.** Self explanatory. There have been too many instances of talking back or not listening to moderators, which makes it harder for us to do our jobs and overall makes our community worse.

I did not in fact have a good birthday, I and most of the people around me forgot it even existed when it happened. The wife has in fact taken all of my worldly possessions with her departure, and I would like to ask what the fukc a pedant is. I have never had her fudge, and for that I assume I should be grateful. My children were wimps. They cried infinitely too much for a two year old, and I am not sorry to see them gone. As you said, their \"common sense\" was to constantly attempt to steal my massive knife collection, after which I threatened to stab them. I am still confused as to why my wife left me. Thank you for the powder. I will nurture and savor it until my dying breath.\nAlways suffering,\nMr. Fidel",

  "Middle school law dictates that each eighth grader must choose one favored student the year below them, else the delicate fabric of puberty and awkwardness, with its intricate weavings, may simply fall apart, leaving countless children stranded in what is simply known as \"The Void\". Those seventh graders who weren't chosen as a favorite by the end of the year must then fight to the death using the plastic rulers that they give us to put in the planners we never use. This can often take a while, as usage of anything other than the ruler is strictly prohibited. If the ruler breaks, they must then eat the questionable burrito bowls from the lunch line for the rest of their days, even if they were to, somehow, get out alive. We inform the audience that breaking or attempting to break any of these rules will result in death and/or exposure to the highly radioactive substance known simply as \"American cheese\". For more, see the Comprehensive Guide to Inner-Middle-School-Workings.",

An article from the New York Lies says that, and I quote, \u201cRick Astley has long been famed for his ability to never give you up, or let you down.\u201d However, if you put the nerds at 3 o\u2019clock into this equation, and Rick Astley needs to get some potatoes from the world\u2019s largest potato farms, the soggy potatoes will cause Rick Astley to go back on this long anticipated promise, given in the 1987 hit song Never Gonna Give You Up. This is because if the nerds at three o\u2019clock don\u2019t get involved, then that fat mama over there will kill the world\u2019s largest potato farms and we won\u2019t have to worry about Rick Astley getting soggy potatoes. This is very bad because rick rolls are amazing. Each year, approximately 6942 million billion trillion people get rickrolled. And studies show that people who get rickrolled live significantly longer than people who don\u2019t. Because of this, we cannot let the world\u2019s largest potato give Rick Astley soggy potatoes.",

  "<@!696489772134432862> Your opinion is invalid and incorrect. I have more than 1000 hours in Breath of the Wild and have played enough Genshin to not be early game anymore. BotW is a better game in almost all aspects. Just because Genshin has more characters that are more attractive doesn't mean the game is good. BotW has far better graphics than Genshin, even on the lowest settings. It is also FAR less laggy because it is a singleplayer game. While Genshin may have a multiplayer option, it isn't necessary in either games. The storyline of BotW is much more consistant as well, and you can progress as fast or as slow as you want, without needing to grind for tens of hours to unlock a quest. BotW has less RNG involved with it, which is something Genshin has too much of. You need to be lucky to progress in Genshin via wish system. The combat in BotW is far better as well. The boss fights are far more involved and have thought put into them. In Genshin, you just spam left click until the HP bar goes to 0. There are no special attacks that need strategy to avoid and the balancing to defeat these bosses is terrible. The reason the balancing in Genshin is so messed up is the fact that there are tons of upgrades in the game that add percentages of stats, instead of minimal amounts of the stat added onto the base stats of the piece. I have far more to say about why Genshin is inferior to BotW, and I am free to debate weekends and after 3:30 Monday-Friday. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

  "Dear Mr. Fiedel,\nMy sincere apologies for misspelling your surname. This grievous mistake will likely happen again. I am ecstatic that you had a horrible birthday, and we all aspire to do the same. Now, I hope that this definition finds you in atrocious health. A pedant is one who excessively concerns themselves with minor details, particularly when it comes to academics. For example, one who corrects a small typing error in one's name. Alas, it is a pity that your wife did not invest her energy in concerning herself over her fudge. I can assure you that it tasted no better than a dog's anal fluids. You talked about your knife collection. This interests me to the highest degree. May I see it (for scientific reasons, of course)? Regardless, if you require more powder, please do not hesitate to ask me.\n\nYour mother,\nMs. Angelise",

  "Squid Game is a Korean show created by Hwang Dong-kyuk for Netflix. If follows the life of Seong Gi-hun, a man stuck in a gambling addict struggling to support his daughter. He then opts into participating into a game of life or death for the cash prize of \u20a945.6 billion or about $3.8 million. The reason why the game exists is to please rich onlookers who bet on who will survive the games at the end.\n\nThe overall show focuses on the lives of those who are less fortunate than most, and how they are willing to risk their lives to escape their current situation. After the first game, the remaining players vote to end the game, but after going back only to have to continue to live through the same struggle, 93% decide to return. This and other events build an anti-capitalist theme as we are shown that the people running the game are those who profit off of Capitalism, and how it has turned them into soulless people who bet on the lives of those less fortunate than them. The show also emphasizes the fact that some people were forced into the situations they were in now, such as Abdul Ali, who is a foreigner forced into the game because his boss refuses to pay him.\n\nThe show also focuses on the guards, who are recruited beforehand and are required to keep their face hidden when around other people. Squid Game characterizes them as actual people, rather than 1 dimensional cut outs, something that most shows do. This revelation is not only for the viewer however, as when one of the participants retaliated after he fails a challenge one of the guards takes of his mask, and the sight of his face causes the participant to back away in shock, not realizing that just like him, the guards he despises are real people too. The cold system of the game however, dictates that both of the men be shot for this transgression something that is executed by one of the higher ranking guards.\n\nOverall, Squid Game is a show that focuses on the failures of Capitalism and the effects it has.",

We have compared heights, and me being 5'2 I am taller. There was quite a significant difference, even with just a 3-4 inches difference. In 6th period orchestra, he also said that he was under 5'0, he himself said such words. I am a Christian and do not lie, at least I try not to over frivolous ordeals. he is short, and while I may not be tall, I am definitely taller than him, without a doubt. I have a claim, evidence, and reasoning shown in this speech. I hope you all reconsider your opinions on the topic and choose the right side. Thank you for your time.",

  "\u200d\n        \u200d\u17b5If you have a challenge, you should never be alone. Having friends would immensely help with anxiety or pressure. I depend on some of my friends to give me advice and comfort when I\u2019m faced with a challenge. You have a lot of friends, as I see it at lunch, you could talk to them, and they\u2019ll be able to comfort you. \n\n        The thoughts, \u201cI won\u2019t be a good student anymore in 8th grade and high school\u201d, \u201cI won\u2019t be going to a good college\u201d, or \u201cI don\u2019t have any talent\u201d are simply irrational. You said \u201canymore\u201d, which suggests that you\u2019re currently a good student in 7th grade. Why would you think that 8th grade and high school would somehow make you a bad student? As long as you turn in assignments, study for tests, and learn ahead, you\u2019re going to be fine. As for going to college, don\u2019t worry about it just now. There are 3 or 4 years ahead that you can use to your advantage. Summer is coming up. Use the 2 months to pick a subject you like, maybe debate or math, and try to learn ahead. This would be extremely helpful for the future and would prepare you for college. \n\n        All in all, I would say that the best thing you could do right now is to use the summertime to study. If your parents are making you do something you don\u2019t like, you could try to talk to them, and they would help. Stay positive, don\u2019t be irrational, and falsely believe that you\u2019re going to fail in the future, and remember: you always have friends that could help you through trouble.",

  "Impact 1: Frank being shorter than an ant leads to less ants dying from Frank stepping on them. You can't bring someone back from death, so this is the most important impact, and you should weigh this before any of my opponent's impacts.\n\nImpact 2: Frank is so small that he is hard to see, so we do not need to look at his ugly face (this is a joke). According to breadstats.org, \"About 99% of people have said that looking at Frank's face has caused them significant mental damage and increased their stress levels.\" Approximately 120,000 people die from stress-related complications and suicide per year. Not being able to see Frank will substantially decrease this number, and will affect nearly all 120,000 people.\n\nJudge, a vote for the opposition is a vote for a world where innocent ants die for no reason because of Frank's extreme cruelty, and where people end their own lives because Frank is just too damn ugly. A vote for me is a vote for a world without these horrors. For these reasons, judge, I strongly urge an affirmative ballot.",

  "Long before time had a name, Ninjago was created by the first spinjitzu master by using the four weapons of spinjitzu. The scythe of quakes, the nunchucks of lightning, the shurikens of ice, and the sword of fire. Weapons so powerful, no one can handle their power all at once. When he passed away, his two sons swore to protect them. But, the oldest was consumed by darkness and wanted to possess them. A battle between brothers broke out and the oldest was struck down and banished to the underworld. Peace returned and the younger brother hid the weapons, but knowing his older brother's relentless ambition for power, he placed a guardian to protect them. And for fear of his own demise, a man for a honest man to hide.",
