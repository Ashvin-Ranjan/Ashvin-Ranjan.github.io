If follows the life of Seong Gi-hun, a man stuck in a gambling addict struggling to support his daughter. He then opts into participating into a game of life or death for the cash prize of \u20a945.6 billion or about $3.8 million. The reason why the game exists is to please rich onlookers who bet on who will survive the games at the end.\n\nThe overall show focuses on the lives of those who are less fortunate than most, and how they are willing to risk their lives to escape their current situation. After the first game, the remaining players vote to end the game, but after going back only to have to continue to live through the same struggle, 93% decide to return. This and other events build an anti-capitalist theme as we are shown that the people running the game are those who profit off of Capitalism, and how it has turned them into soulless people who bet on the lives of those less fortunate than them. The show also emphasizes the fact that some people were forced into the situations they were in now, such as Abdul Ali, who is a foreigner forced into the game because his boss refuses to pay him.\n\nThe show also focuses on the guards, who are recruited beforehand and are required to keep their face hidden when around other people. Squid Game characterizes them as actual people, rather than 1 dimensional cut outs, something that most shows do. This revelation is not only for the viewer however, as when one of the participants retaliated after he fails a challenge one of the guards takes of his mask, and the sight of his face causes the participant to back away in shock, not realizing that just like him, the guards he despises are real people too. The cold system of the game however, dictates that both of the men be shot for this transgression something that is executed by one of the higher ranking guards.\n\nOverall, Squid Game is a show that focuses on the failures of Capitalism and the effects it has.", "<@!645307099970011148>", "unpure silly willy?!?

Due to a lot of recent growth and complaints from server members, as well as concern from the staff team itself, we have decided to change some rules to make this more of a fun and safe community for us all!\n\n1. **Verification changes.**  Verification into the server will be more strict. First, new members are now required to state their name, grade, and school. Not just grade and school, but all three. **Everyone will be required to verify again to make sure these are filled out, so don't panic if you lose access to the server in the next couple of days, just verify again**. Secondly, you will require a vouch from a current member to be verified. If any of these are not filled in properly, you will not be verified.\n\n2. **Inappropriate messages**. While we will tolerate a slightly inappropriate message, any comments that the staff team deems too inappropriate will immediately be removed, and you will receive a warning. Note that 4 warnings will lead to a ban. Additionally, while cursing is okay, any excessive cursing or name calling directed towards a member in a way that they are uncomfortable with will also result in a warn/mute (depending on the severity). We would like to take the time to remind you that no slurs of any kind are allowed.\n\n3. **Respecting staff.** Self explanatory. There have been too many instances of talking back or not listening to moderators, which makes it harder for us to do our jobs and overall makes our community worse. (it's just not cool guys dont do it ) If you have a problem with staff, say it in support or DM <@!371433403163213824> , the owner.You will also receive a warn for disrespecting staff.\n\nThank you so much!\n-the mod team <:aweg:881352292442447932>\n\n**TLDR:** Changes coming soon to verification and moderation.", "star this.", "<:laserMatt:776584891596275774><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserShaft:776584969661317170><:laserTip:776585054356635708><:trumphigh:885730711175327785>", "bread dynamic v11", "nono, i like being wet", "DSAL;FJ;ADSJF", "SAFDKLJSDFJKKAJKL", "this server dumb whatevs", "I did 2 women", "LMAOOO I HAVE THE NOTE"]
