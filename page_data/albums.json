        "about": "Death Grips if they were extremely online is how I would describe Kaizo Slumber, not in a bad way. The sound of this album is loud, and the screaming vocals are extremely powerful when combined with the hard electric guitar, insane drum loops, and heavy use of sampling. Overall, an extremely creative album, transitioning from rock, to calm jazz, to Vietnam War-era protest song all in 25 minutes. The album also has one of my favorite covers to boot."

The album mixes amazing beats, tight flows, and very meaningful messages into a very enjoyable listening experience from beginning to end, with some of my favorite songs JPEGMAFIA has produced on the mixtape. However, it has been taken off of Bandcamp and Spotify for uncleared samples, so you can only find it unoffically reuploaded on YouTube. Despite this, it is definitely worth a listen."
